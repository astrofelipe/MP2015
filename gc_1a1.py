#! Padova, March 31 2015
#!
#! This is a FORTRAN routine to correct the geometric distortion of
#! VIRCAM@VISTA detector released with the paper Libralato et al. (2015).
#!
#! A typical run will look like:
#!
#!       call VIRCAM_gc_J(xraw,yraw,chipnumber,xcorr,ycorr)
#!
#!
#! The use of this distortion solution is encouraged regardless of the
#! specific method adopted to measure stellar positions. Each meta catalog
#! is projected into a plane tangential to its center. This offers the
#! best single-catalog, distortion-free positions. Please note that, in
#! order to construct a common reference frame, all meta catalogs should
#! be instead projected into the same tangent plane
#!
#!
#! Please acknowledge the use of this routine in any published work tha
#! make use of it.  The proper citation is the paper:
#!
#!       Libralato et al. (2015), arXiv: 1503.07519

#! Kind regards,
